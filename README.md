# Redux Toolkit

The aim of this project was to learn about state management in react using the Redux Toolkit.

## How the project was implemented

The idea was to fetch dummy data about certain shopping items and populate the client side.
There came a challenge to handle the many states and hooks that i used, the only option could be Redux toolkit.
I could not so much consider React context Api because this was not so much of a simpler or light weight state management scenario.

### Project status

The project is under constuction.
### Under customization !!!
